                    With trust comes action. Businesses that share custom links see a boost in click-throughs. It’s
                    simple:
                    If your audience trusts your links and knows where they lead, they’re more likely to click on

                    click-throughs.

                    automatically
                    use the custom domain for that business, increasing awareness for your brand and giving you

                </button>
                <p>A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems like a simple tool, but it is a service
                    that can have a dramatic impact on your marketing efforts.<br><br>
                    Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname for your long webpage address.
                    You can, for example, use a short URL like bit.ly/CelebrateBitly so people will have a good
                    idea about where your link will lead before they click it.<br><br>
                    If you’re contributing content to the online world, you need a URL shortener.<br><br>
                    Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener above.<br><br>

            <div class="question">
                <button>
                    <span> what are the benefits of a short URL</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
                </button>
                <p>How many people can even remember a long web address, especially if it has tons of characters
                    and symbols? A short URL can make your link more memorable. Not only does it allow people to
                    easily recall and share your link with others, it can also dramatically improve traffic to
                    your content.<br><br>
                    On a more practical side, a short URL is also easier to incorporate into your collateral –
                    whether you’re looking to engage with your customers offline or online.<br><br>
                    URL shortener is the best URL shortener for everyone, from influencers to small brands to large
                    enterprises,
                    who are looking for a simple way to create, track and manage their links.

                <button>
                    <span>What is a custom URL shortener?</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
                </button>
                <p>A custom URL shortener, sometimes referred to as a branded URL shortener, lets you brand your
                    links.<br><br>
                    For example, instead of bit.ly/2m75BWD, you could use a custom short URL like
                    yourbrnd.co/2m75BWD.<br><br>
                    There are several benefits of branding your short links. Branded links build trust between your
                    audience and
                    your business, drive more clicks, give your audience a preview of where they are being taken and
                    increase brand
                    awareness.<br><br>
                    A link shortening service that includes custom short URLs is vital to improving audience
                    engagement
                    with your communications. A short URL is good, but a custom URL works every time.
